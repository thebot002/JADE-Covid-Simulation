For this project, I set myself to develop a JADE multiagent system in order to simulate the spread of an illness (in this case COVID) within a population. This is inspired by the video of 3Blue1Brown (https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs). I want to implement various features to simulate as faithfully as possible the spread of a decease. These feature include the fact of having multiple containers, simulating different countries, from which agents can travel to and from. Or the ability to tune how contagious the disease is using parameters such as the contamination radius and probability. Then, the severeness of the disease using parameter of the average length of sickness. Then, to exploit the possibilities of the JADE platform, I attempted to make it possible to create containers on a different computer on the same network to share the computational load of the simulation between different hosts.
